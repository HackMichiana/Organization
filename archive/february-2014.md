**Bus Route Project**

Gretchen has been working with bus route information, attempting to get it onto a map and online. She could maybe use a little assistance with that. Perhaps that is something Josh can help with. Anybody else?

If we can get the information in the right format and provided to Google, there's a chance people could use public transit routing in South Bend. 

**Discussion of Shoveling Project**

Problem: The city's 311 operators receive calls from people who are unable to shovel their own walkways and/or drives. The city does not provide this service, and has nowhere to refer people to. Is this something that civic data and cooperation with the city could help address? 

**The idea might go like this:**

Somebody who has a snow removal need calls 311. 311 operator provides a phone number for that person to call to be connected to people willing to assist. The 311 caller then calls the new number, a 'clearing house' of sorts, providing information on the need. The clearing house has a pool of people/organizations willing to help do this type of work, and can connect the two. 

What might be a minimum structure we could put in place to see if this is viable?

**Ideas/Concerns/Considerations**

What about liability?

Background check for volunteers?

Reward system? (coffee shop - Main Street, South Bend Chocolate Cafe)
(Track Points)

Build community - go somewhere together after the event?

**Discussion of Adopt-A-Hydrant Project**

(note: skipping the bus stop idea for now)

**What would be needed to redeploy the adopt-a- platform?**

We need data (Santi)

John and Steve (github guys) and Gretchen redeployed the adopt-a-
platform already, so doing it for hydrants might not be that hard.

Partner with Neighborhood associations for volunteers who might be
willing to help out (Beth and David) 

After there is something usable, the city can help with communication

**Questions asked:**

Can the city bill homeowners if a volunteer does the mowing instead of city crews?
