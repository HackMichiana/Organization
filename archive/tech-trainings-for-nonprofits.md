- We have tentative permission to use IUSB hospitality money for catering stuff, they're excited to see folks on campus
- However, every weekend in June is going to be orientation. The first one for prospective honors students was last week. The day after classes end/before finals week will be the first proper one
- The computer labs will be full. All of them.
- IUSB Library?
- Classrooms would work too
- IUSB has carts of chromebooks now, so we could get those if they'd be useful. Though if someone is coming to a tech workshop then they'd probably bring a laptop.
- [Nonprofit Technology Conference](http://www.nten.org) - helps nonprofits learn about tech
- It's April 8th, so we could probably start inviting people in two weeks or so.
- Folks who want to come, we could send them a survey about what they're interested in/what they use
- Train the trainer-style - Is there something you use in your nonprofit that you'd like to teach others about?
- Another survey after they've arrived, relating to what they expect to get out of the event

(Note: This event ended up falling through as we decided to focus on outreach more.)
