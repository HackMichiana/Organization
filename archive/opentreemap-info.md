[OpenTreeMap](http://opentreemap.github.io/) is a platform for crowdsourcing tree inventory.Features include:* Apps for Android and iOS that allow for location capture and photo uploads* Optional integrated tree key to assist in identifying tree species* Tree records can be added/later edited to include species name, location, height, plot size and type, conditions, actions needed, funding sources, and ownership data* User accounts to allow for comments and system edits* Automatically calculate ecosystem services (greenhouse gas, water, energy,  air quality) based on a tree’s species and diameterOpenTreeMap tracks the completeness of an entry, allowing trees to be entered into the database without full information and have the information added at a later time.Check out these sites that are currently running on the platform: * Tampa, FL: [http://www.tampatreemap.usf.edu/](http://www.tampatreemap.usf.edu/)* Grand Rapids, MI: [http://treemap.urbanforestproject.com/map/](http://treemap.urbanforestproject.com/map/)
